---------

Changes since 0.2.4
	* added copyright/license text to all source files
	* updated license to LGPL from GPL
	* Replace URLConnection use with Apache commons-httpclient, which has
	*   support for connection timeout configuration
	* fixed a getVisibility() bug that was throwing an NPE

Changes since 0.2.3
	* Fixed CAVOK problem.  Was specifying 10 miles instead of 10 kilometers
	* Support for visibility tokens like '9999' added.  Similar to CAVOK, means
	* visibility greater than 10KM
	* Added support for NOSIG
	* Added support for NSC

Changes since 0.2.2
	* various bugfixes for international reporting stations
	* - CAVOK now supported (885981)
	* - visibility in kilometers and meters now supported (877179, 877181)
	* - wind speed in meters/second now supported (877183)
	* support for fractional visibilities (875903)
	* made thread safe (875919)

Changes since 0.2.1
	* Moved all METAR-related classes into the subpackage 'metar'
	* Split up METAR downloading and parsing
	* Added a file that contains all METAR-related constants
	* Added junit test file for the METAR classes (still needs work)
	* Added fix for fractional and "less than" visibilities
	* Miscellaneous bug fixes

	* special thanks goes to Dennis Keller <dennis@bullamanka.com> for
	  bug fixes and initiating a change in the structure of jweather that
	  should make things more maintainable for the future.

Changes since 0.2
	* Fixed a bug regarding variable wind direction.  "VRB" is listed only
	  in the case where the variable wind is <= 6 knots in speed.  Else, it
	  is coded in the token immediately following in the format
		F F F VF F F
		  n n n  x x x
	  Was only checking to see if the next token was variable wind
	  direction if VRB was set, which is incorrect.
	  
	  Thanks to bobzilla for identifying the problem.

Changes since 0.1
	* Removed all JDK 1.4 regexp calls (e.g. matches() & split()) and
	  replaced them with the equivalent Jakarta ORO calls
	* Bundling ORO with jweather
